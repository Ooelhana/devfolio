description: 'Join me as I revive my previously short-lived writing career'
---

Hey there, welcome to my blog! I have recently started my first professional job as a software developer and I’ve been really enjoying it so far and have been learning a lot of interesting things related to software development. I’m starting this blog as a means to start recording and reflecting on the things that I’ve learned in my job and in my free time.

I used to write articles when I was younger for websites like Triond, Hubpages and Factoidz. These websites would post user generated content and give a portion of the ad revenue  made from the article to the writer. At the time, I wanted to make money because I was still too young to get a real job. In that, I was mostly unsuccessful, unfortunately there isn’t much of a user base interested in reading mediocre unfocused articles written by 13 year olds but I found a lot of value in the experience and really enjoyed the writing that I did. 

I wrote about a variety of topics: opinion pieces, research topics and product reviews. Writing forces you to reflect and understand what you are writing about in a way that I think no other medium does. Finding the right words to explain something that you intuitively understand can be a lot trickier than you would think.

Since that time, roughly ten years ago I have not written much. In fact, in university, I specifically would avoid taking courses that required the writing of essays. In this blog, I hope to revive my previously short-lived writing career and if some people find some value in my experiences then I am glad to be able to share them with you.
